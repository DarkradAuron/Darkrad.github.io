In this small project, I wanted to work with Pandas in Python to clean some data from a small collection of data from ESPN about Cricket players. 
Using Jupyter Notebook as a method of working with the code and the data, I will provide the code and screenshots to show how the process worked out. 
I wanted to follow through with this project to better understand Pandas in the context of data analytics and to better hone my Python skills.
